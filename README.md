The dataset does not include information on external factors (e.g., weather, airport conditions) that may affect customer satisfaction.
Further analysis and validation may be required to draw conclusive recommendations.

Future Work:

Conduct customer surveys or feedback analysis to gather real-time insights into satisfaction levels and areas for improvement.
Incorporate external data sources to enhance the analysis and gain a comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction dynamics.
Overall, continuous monitoring and analysis of customer satisfaction data are essential for airlines to remain competitive and deliver exceptional experiences to their customers.
